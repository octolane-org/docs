# Integrations

Octolane stays self-driving by tapping into Gmail and Google Calendar with least-privilege access.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Gmail" icon="envelope">
    - What we access: headers, participants, timestamps, subjects, and relevant body snippets.  
    - Why: detect new contacts, next steps, sentiment, and deal movement.  
    - How it’s used: mapped to accounts/contacts/opportunities; updates written back automatically.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Google Calendar" icon="calendar-days">
    - What we access: event metadata, attendees, timestamps, and meeting notes you choose to sync.  
    - Why: add meetings to timelines, detect next steps, and surface risks from no-shows.  
    - How it’s used: meetings attach to the right records with owners and follow-ups.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
