# Security & Privacy

We’re a self-driving CRM, but we treat your data like production code—tightly controlled and observable.

    Data in transit: TLS 1.2+. Data at rest: AES-256. Secrets stored via managed KMS with strict rotation.

    We process Gmail and Calendar data to extract signals, store only what’s needed to power automations, and minimize retention.

## What we store vs process

- Store: normalized activity metadata, enrichment results, and CRM field updates tied to your workspace.  
- Process (not persist by default): raw Gmail/Calendar payloads are streamed, parsed, and discarded after extraction unless you opt into retention for audit.

## Access controls

- Least-privilege scopes for Gmail and Calendar; no blanket mailbox downloads.  
- SSO and MFA encouraged for workspace admins; role-based access for data visibility.  
- Admin controls to revoke integrations instantly.

## Compliance and trust

- SOC 2 Type II (see [Security](https://www.octolane.com/security) for details).  
- Vendor due diligence and data processing agreements for subprocessors.

## Your controls

- Revoke integrations at any time; data deletion on request.  
- Export your data when needed.  
- Report an issue: [security@octolane.com](mailto:security@octolane.com).
