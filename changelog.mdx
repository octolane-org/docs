You can now upload and organize files in Octolane! Supported file types include PDFs for now and more are coming. Create folders to manage them efficientlyâ€”everything is automatically mapped to the related account, contact, or opportunity.

To manage files and folders, click on any record from the table or open an individual record page. From there, you can upload, organize, and control files and folders.

Introducing the new Activity Panel! Now, you can view the complete history of emails and meetings for any contact, account, or opportunity in one place.

To check the activity of any record, click on a record from the table or open its individual page. From there, you can see upcoming events, past email interactions, and meetings. Click on any interaction to view more details.

### Fixes

- **[Editing record]** Fixed a bug where selecting multiple options was not working while editing a record.
- **[Navigation]** Fixed an issue where visiting Octolane Support resulted in an error.
- **[File Management]** Fixed an issue where the context menu would open in a random corner instead of the correct position.

### Improvement

- **[Record Details in Table]** Record details are now editable and faster to navigate from the right-side panel.
