## Common troubleshooting

- Can’t see updates? Confirm Gmail and Calendar connections are active; re-auth if scopes expired.  
- Missing contacts? Check that emails include participants you expect; we dedupe strict domains.  
- Wrong account mapping? Move the record once; we remember the corrected mapping going forward.

If you need a human, email us with a link or screenshot—we’ll fix it with you.
